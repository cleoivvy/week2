      <h2>protein</h2>
      <p>
        Protein is one of the organic foodstuffs, with its end product of
        digestion as amino- acids. It is found in both plant and animal food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proteins support growth, repair and maintenance of tissues. Every
        molecule of protein is made up of thousands of amino acids. Our body
        needs these elements to create new proteins and maintain the existing
        ones. Protein that can be produced in our body is called non-essential
        protein, while protein that can not be produced there is called
        non-essential.
